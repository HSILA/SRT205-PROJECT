### **Task List for Team Lead**

### **1. Audit & Compliance Reporting**

**Develop the `audit_compliance` Role**  
- Implement a security auditing role that:  
  - Collects compliance data from Ubuntu & Windows systems.  
  - Generates automated reports using **Jinja2 templates**.  
  - Logs security configurations & non-compliant settings.  

**Validate Security Configurations**  
- Run CIS compliance scans and document results.  
- Ensure that configurations are **properly enforced** and **no critical settings are left misconfigured**.  

**Generate Compliance Reports**  
- Automate **Ansible report generation** using Jinja2.  
- Ensure compliance reports include:  
  - Summary of applied security configurations.  
  - Logs of security changes made via Ansible.  

**Document Non-Compliant Issues**  
- Identify failed compliance checks and assign fixes to the respective OS specialists.

### **2. Security Best Practices & Vault Management**

**Implement Secure Credential Management**  
- Set up **Ansible Vault** to store sensitive credentials securely.  
- Ensure that **SSH keys, passwords, and security configs** are **encrypted** and **only accessible to authorized users**.  

**Review Team Membersâ€™ Security Configurations**  
- Audit all playbooks to confirm:  
  - No hardcoded passwords.  
  - Secure configurations applied to all systems.  
  - CIS benchmark recommendations followed.

### **3. Playbook Integration & Execution**

**Develop `main.yml` for Centralized Execution**  
- Create a **master playbook (`main.yml`)** that integrates all roles.  
- Ensure the execution **automates the full CIS compliance setup** for all systems.  

**Test Playbook Execution**  
- Run **end-to-end testing** on Ubuntu & Windows environments.  
- Validate correct enforcement of CIS settings.  
- Debug & fix any failures in execution.  

**Implement Error Handling**  
- Use **block-rescue**, `assert`, and `fail` for fault tolerance.  
- Ensure playbooks **fail gracefully** and provide clear error messages.

### **4. GitHub Repository & Documentation**

**Ensure Proper GitHub Structure**  
- Enforce **meaningful commit messages**.  
- Ensure each team member follows **branching strategies**.  
- Maintain an organized **directory structure** for roles, playbooks, and documentation.  

**Review & Approve PRs (Pull Requests)**  
- Validate contributions before merging to the main branch.  

**Ensure README.md is Well-Documented**  
- Ensure **execution logs, compliance reports, and setup instructions** are included.  

---

### **5. Submission & Final Review**

**Verify All Deliverables**  
- Ensure the following are **completed and submitted**:  
  - GitHub Repository (playbooks, roles, documentation).  
  - Compliance reports generated via Jinja2.  
  - Execution logs.  

**Final Review & Approval**  
- Conduct a **final security audit** before submission.  
- Validate **all CIS tasks have been implemented correctly**.  

---

This structured approach will **ensure smooth execution** of the project while maintaining **CIS compliance, security best practices, and Ansible automation standards**. ðŸš€
