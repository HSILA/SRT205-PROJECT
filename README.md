## **Overview of CIS Compliance**

The **Center for Internet Security (CIS)** provides best practices for securing systems against cyber threats. These **CIS benchmarks** help organizations improve their security posture by ensuring that systems are securely configured to reduce vulnerabilities and exposure to attacks.

### **Why is CIS Compliance Important?**

- **Enhanced Security** ‚Äì Reduces attack surfaces by applying secure configurations.
- **Industry Standards** ‚Äì Aligns with security frameworks and regulatory requirements.
- **Risk Reduction** ‚Äì Minimizes security misconfigurations and improves resilience.
- **Audit & Compliance Readiness** ‚Äì Facilitates security audits and regulatory compliance.

## **Project Objective**

This project utilizes **Ansible** to automate **CIS compliance tasks** on **Windows, Ubuntu, and Amazon Linux 2 systems**. Students will:

- Develop **Ansible Playbooks** to implement security controls.
- Structure configurations using **Ansible Roles**.
- Secure sensitive data using **Ansible Vault**.
- Generate **dynamic compliance reports** using **Jinja2**.
- Implement **error handling mechanisms** for reliability.
- **Utilize GitHub** for collaboration and version control.

## **Project Deliverables**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ CIS Compliance Implementation**

- Implement **at least 10 CIS compliance tasks** for each assigned operating system.
- Ensure configurations follow **Ansible best practices**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Modular Ansible Role Implementation**

- Organize automation tasks into **Ansible Roles**:
  - `cis_ubuntu`: Manages CIS compliance for Ubuntu.
  - `cis_windows`: Manages CIS compliance for Windows.
  - `cis_amazon`: Manages CIS compliance for Amazon Linux 2. (**for 4 member team only**)
  - `audit_compliance`: Implements security auditing and reporting.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Credential Management**

- Use **Ansible Vault** to protect sensitive credentials (e.g., SSH keys, passwords).

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Compliance Reporting**

- Use **Jinja2 templates** to generate **dynamic compliance reports**.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Complete Playbook Execution**

- Develop a **main playbook (`main.yml`)** that integrates all roles.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Robust Error Handling**

- Implement mechanisms like `assert`, `fail`, `block`, and `rescue` for fault tolerance.

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Version Control & Documentation**

- Maintain a well-structured **GitHub repository**:
  - Meaningful **commit messages**.
  - Organized **project directory**.
  - Clear **README.md documentation** with setup and execution instructions.

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Final Project Presentation**

- Deliver a **10-minute presentation** detailed in [Presentation_Instruction](Presentation_Instruction.md)

## **Work Options: Individual or Team-Based**

Students may complete this project **individually** or as part of a **team (up to 4 members)**.

### **Option 1: Team Collaboration (Recommended)**

Each team member will take on a specialized role:

- **Ubuntu Specialist**: Develops the `cis_ubuntu` role.
- **Windows Specialist**: Develops the `cis_windows` role.
- **Amazon Linux 2 Specialist**: Develops the `cis_amazon` role. (**for 4 member team only**)
- **Team Lead**: Manages `audit_compliance`, security reporting, and project coordination.

### **Option 2: Individual Work**

If working alone, the student must:

- Select **one OS role** (`cis_ubuntu`, `cis_windows`, or `cis_amazon`).
- Develop and test the **`audit_compliance` role**.
- Provide a **detailed final report**.
- Ensure all deliverables meet security and best practice standards.
